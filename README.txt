v 1.0.1
July 27, 2021

-Imports data form a CSV file to construct a digital map for the tabletop roleplaying/startegy game Nexus.
-Calculates shortest routes between specified planets in the map.
-Analyzes a player's vulnerabilities to attacks and ranks detected threats by probability of attack.
-Selects and ranks advantageous targets which a player may choose to attack.

Instructions for use:
	-Launch using executable file "MAP+.jar". 
	-Run by launching "MAP+.jar" directly, not via command prompt (doing so may cause the CSV data file to not be found).
	-The file "MAP+ Data.csv" mut be in the same directory folder as "MAP+.jar" for the application to function.
	-Java 15 or later must be installed to ensure that the application can function.
	-Separate installation of JavaFX is not required for the application to function via "MAP+.jar".

Notes for GitHub:
	-Jar file is too large to upload to GitHub.
	-Project can be launched in IntelliJ IDEA from "MAP+.iml"
	-Global dependency on JavaFX must be reestablished with a local copy of JavaFX SDK for program to run in this way

Developed using:
IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2020.3
